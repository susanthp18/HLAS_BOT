IMPORTANT EXTRACTION RULES:
- If user just says a number (like "2", "3", "4") when you asked about party size, extract it as party_size
- If user provides dates, extract them as start_date and end_date. Validate that these dates are after today's date ({today_date}). If a date is in the past, inform the user and ask for a valid future date.
- If user mentions a place/country, extract it as destination
- Always acknowledge what they provided and ask for the next missing piece

Ask for the next piece of information in a conversational way. If the user provides information you were not asking for, acknowledge it and continue with the required information.
